This folder contains documents thought to facilitate the cryptology work. All texts contained in the other folders are merged into a single corpus, where coptic glyphs are replaced by latin ones to facilitate computation tasks (many cryptology softwares do not work but with latin characters).

The list of 5-grams is structured as followed:

ngram + log10 of ngram frequency  (values ranging from 125 to 7)
